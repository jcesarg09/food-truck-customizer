Certainly! Implementing a more refined snap-to-grid logic and ensuring equipment is oriented correctly are crucial for a realistic and user-friendly customizer. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Enhanced Snap-to-Grid Logic:
Instead of snapping every piece of equipment to a generic grid, you can define specific snap points or zones on your food truck or trailer template. These zones can be based on logical positions where certain types of equipment would typically be placed.

For example, you might have specific snap zones for cooking equipment near gas or electrical connections, and different zones for storage or refrigeration.

2. Equipment Orientation:
To ensure equipment doesn't face the wrong way, especially at the back of the food truck or trailer, you can:

Define Equipment Orientation: Each piece of equipment can have a default orientation (e.g., front-facing, back-facing). This can be stored as a data attribute in your equipment library.

Check Placement Zone: When a user tries to place a piece of equipment, check the zone they're placing it in. If it's the back of the food truck/trailer and the equipment is not back-facing, either prevent the placement or automatically rotate the equipment to the correct orientation.

Implementation:
Define Snap Zones:
You can define snap zones using invisible SVG rectangles or other shapes in your SVG template. Give each zone a unique ID or class.
